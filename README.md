# Cryptocurrency-assignment-ScroogeCoin
In this lab, you will implement the ScroogeCoin cryptocurrency. 
You will act as Scrooge and verify transactions sent to you by users and add them to your ledger. 
Your submission will only be the DefaultScroogeCoinServer.java class. 
Do not modify any of the other existing classes, as the auto-grading script will use the original implementations of all the other classes. 
Your grade will be based entirely on the percent of test cases passed. 
A few JUnit test cases have been given to you as sanity checks on your code, but the grading will be based different test cases. 
You should invest time in developing your own test cases.
